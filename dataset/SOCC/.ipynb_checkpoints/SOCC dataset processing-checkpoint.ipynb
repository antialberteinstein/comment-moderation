      "While technology does march on, sometimes it takes a few backwards steps towards true progress. Case in point are the ipads and tablets which I see as little more than toys for the easily distracted. While tablets are today's rage that have led to the nosediving of the laptop, anyone who has used these new devices knows all to well their limitations. Trying to compose an email on a ipad is like communicating in morse code or sending a telegram circa 1913. The same goes for the smartwatch which does not even have GPS, which every cheap digital camera has, big mistake. But what do I know, I'm a geezer and still tell the time by a watch with a face.\n",
      "Everyone is still missing the point of what the Apple Watch is:It's fashion. It is by definition of no utility. Watches have been more fashion than function for as long as they've been worn. Anyone remember paying $50 for a Swatch that cost $2 to make? The Apple Watch actually offers quite a bit of utility as far as wrist adornments go, but it is first and foremost something to look good. It was never meant to replace an iPhone so people need to stop evaluating it on that basis. As for rapid, pervasive obsolescence of your latest gadget, it's an unfortunate side-effect of Moore's Law. You don't have to buy the latest and greatest if you don't want to, but a lot of people want to.I will likely end up with an Apple Watch for the following ironic reason: I haven't worn a watch in years because I have had a phone in my pocket that already does the one thing a watch does: tell time. Now, with an Apple Watch, I'll get the convenience of telling the time without having to get a hand free to get my phone out of my pocket and still have a device that gives me access to much of the stuff I turn to my iPhone for already.

      "Everyone is still missing the point of what the Apple Watch is:It's fashion. It is by definition of no utility. Watches have been more fashion than function for as long as they've been worn. Anyone remember paying $50 for a Swatch that cost $2 to make? The Apple Watch actually offers quite a bit of utility as far as wrist adornments go, but it is first and foremost something to look good. It was never meant to replace an iPhone so people need to stop evaluating it on that basis. As for rapid, pervasive obsolescence of your latest gadget, it's an unfortunate side-effect of Moore's Law.

      "The historic head tax was meant to dissuade ethnic Chinese from coming to and staying in BC. As the BC property transfer tax applies to individuals who are neither Canadian citizens nor permanent residents, it's intent and effect will be to encourage foreigners, Chinese among others, who weren't intending to stay in BC to become permanent residents or citizens. So the intent and effect is the opposite of the head tax.\n",

      "Simpson is right: it's a political winner and a policy dud - just political smoke and mirrors. Mulcair wants Canada to adopt a national childcare model so he can hang on to seats in Quebec, that's all. Years ago I worked with a political strategist working to get a Liberal candidate elected in Conservative Calgary. He actually told his client to talk about national daycare - this was in the early 90's. The Liberal candidate said, 'Canada can't afford that!' to which the strategist responded 'Just say the words, you don't have to actually do it. It'll be good for votes.' I could barely believe the cynicism, but over the years I've come to realize that's what it is: vote getting and power politics. Same thing here.\n",
