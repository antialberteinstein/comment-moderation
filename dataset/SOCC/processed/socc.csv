"Everyone is still missing the point of what the Apple Watch is:It's fashion. It is by definition of no utility. Watches have been more fashion than function for as long as they've been worn. Anyone remember paying $50 for a Swatch that cost $2 to make? The Apple Watch actually offers quite a bit of utility as far as wrist adornments go, but it is first and foremost something to look good. It was never meant to replace an iPhone so people need to stop evaluating it on that basis. As for rapid, pervasive obsolescence of your latest gadget, it's an unfortunate side-effect of Moore's Law. You don't have to buy the latest and greatest if you don't want to, but a lot of people want to.I will likely end up with an Apple Watch for the following ironic reason: I haven't worn a watch in years because I have had a phone in my pocket that already does the one thing a watch does: tell time. Now, with an Apple Watch, I'll get the convenience of telling the time without having to get a hand free to get my phone out of my pocket and still have a device that gives me access to much of the stuff I turn to my iPhone for already. It really does make sense if you put it in the right perspective.",0.9111,normal

One can sympathize with the perspective of fellow Canadians who question why we should be responsible for these, or any, refugees. That we have our own problems, including poverty.

There is not much humanitarian about Canada's policy re Syria refugees, which is basically an extension of its immigration policy, as far as I can tell. Canada is picking the 'good' ones and leaving the 'bad' ones for Europe. And Canada is simply not taking it's fair share. Germany took 40 times more refugees than Canada last year.

"It's absolutely not racist, I've lived in Vancouver since I was born and it's gotten to the point where there's a mass exodus of locals (of any race) to find somewhere where they can live in a reasonable way. Vancouver is becoming (if it hasn't already) a city with 2 classes the rich, or the just trying to scrape by. And I major part of that is due to exploitative foreign investment.

"I live in Quebec, worked in the Social Services.. I have seen how our Que daycare works. All to often it is the ones who could pay more that end up using the daycare system. They actually put their names onto a list for a spot in selected daycare, the minute the mother is expecting. I have even heard of cases of parents who are planning a baby in next two years to get a name on a list. Meanwhile those low income working moms and families have to wait years to have a spot in a daycare. Why, because they are not as aware of 'how to work the system' as the others. People put their kids in daycare, higher income families, sometimes for no other reason to have time to do what they want, they do NOT work.. The concept of daycare is good, but must be better monitored with perhaps slanting pay scale so that the ones for which the idea came to be, can benefit.

Do they really need government assistance? Many comfortably off people will shift their discretionary income (from saved daycare costs) to buy a larger house or more expensive doodads.

"The author knows the odds against the NDP gaining power next year are about as high as the odds against Putin winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The NDP is reverting to its traditional role, which historically was to promote big-ticket social programs and hope they would gain sufficient public support to be adopted and enacted by the Liberal party. Much of Canada's social progress has relied on this dynamic. However, provincial governments are likely far more jaded at this stage. The cost-sharing model on which medicare was established, for instance, was fairly swiftly abandoned by the federal government, leaving provinces increasingly holding the bag for health care funding, which now eats up about fifty percent of provincial revenues in some jurisdictions. Even Martin's belated reforms, temporarily continued by Harper, barely restored a fraction of the funding losses the provinces have endured. Why would the province's agree to another bait-and-switch scheme? My guess is that the chance all ten can be brought on board is somewhere between nil and zero.",0.6683,normal

"I share Margaret Wente's confusion over the adulation we see everywhere for Pope Francis. When it comes to core Catholic beliefs, he is very conservative. After all, he was elected by a very conservative group of cardinals that has been stocked by the recent popes, all of whom where conservative too. So it was very unlikely they would choose anyone who would rock the boat. I think people are confusing his sincere personal preferences for humiity and a low key lifestyle and a warm personality for openess and liberality. Pope Francis may deal with opposition through persuasion, example and kindness rather than force and pressure, but his goal is to lead back to the conservative fold, not a more open liberal place.",0.8854,normal

"Ah, Ms. Wente is (1) a conservative and (2) I'm pretty sure wasn't raised a Catholic. The pope is expressing some liberal ideas that stick in her craw, fair enough. Personally, I think there's a number of things going on. Pope Francis is doing a great PR job for the church without really deviating from the Church's overall theological position. The church needs some recharging, and he's doing his best to provide it without deviating from core theology. He was a priest and bishop in South America, and saw a kind of poverty there that few popes (all Europeans, and until recently, all from Italy) have ever seen. Christianity - for all the focus the Church has placed on these things in the past few decades - was not meant to be about sexual orientation, abortion issues, and other modern day preoccupations. Its original imperative was about love and compassion, with a strong injunction to help the poor, as well as a focus on the life of the spirit versus the material. In focusing on poverty and questioning the rampant materialism of the modern age, he's going back to the roots of the religion (sadly mostly lost in the last 2000 years). As for environmentalism, why not? This I think is part of the great PR he's doing, there's nothing controversial about it from the Church's perspective, and it's a very hot topic these days. Whether he (or the Church) are really embracing it is anyone's guess.",0.9099,normal
"If the Pope is cautious on indicating a favourable disposition on ordaining women as priests, he might want to look at Anglicanism's experience.

They have been ordaining women as priests for twenty years now, along with other Provinces of the Anglican Communion, and now the number of women in theological colleges preparing for ordination are well outnumbering men. The result being that men are leaving the church in droves. In addition to this women are getting all the senior appointments, and come from a background of, in many cases, militant feminism.

"I understand that the taxi system is broken ($100,000+ for a license plate is ludicrous) and for sure needs fixing but suggesting that we drive with total strangers not unlike hitchhiking seems very unsafe for these reasons: 1) taxis are inspected more rigorously, 2) taxis are insured, 3) taxi drivers are safety and CPR trained, 4) taxi drivers must pass a background check . My family does not hitch hike and I honestly don't see the difference between hitch hiking and Uber. I just signed up with Uber and it took less than 15 min only requiring photo uploads of documents and licenses. No verification of these documents. I just don't feel safe until there is some sort of regulation ... also this broken system is not the fault of the individuals who have paid their fees, passed the tests and have committed to serve the city and its patrons.

At the time of permitting a driver needs to show a safety inspection for the vehicle and sufficient insurance coverage paid foe the next 6months. ( the city could even provide an additional insurance plan for a cost!) 4- in addition a driver needs to show a clean driving record for the previous 6 months, no demerit points lost ; if not they get a warning and after two consecutive 6 month periods of warnings, they cannot buy a permit. 5- the up to dat permit needs to be clearly visible at all times. 6- if they switch cars or buy a new one, the driver needs to get a new permit and safety inspection for that car, any outstanding days left on the old car should be prorated. This would go along way to open up the market while insuring minimum standards for vehicle and driver and get rid of the middlemen licence holders...",0.7682,normal

"Information overload is real. And very stressful. The tech revolution is like all revolutions before it. It began with idealism, hope and awesome innovations. Then came the disruptions to the status quo. The arts have suffered dreadfully. Recent reports show incomes for musicians, writers, and artists are way down from a decade ago. But the Tech Rebels scoff at this and call us to look to the Brave New World of Free Information, Art, and Music. One might ask where those who once were paid to write and sing will find money to eat, but that just makes you a reactionary and a counter-revolutionary. Food can now be printed on one's 3-D printer, says the Comrade of Tech. I'm tempted to scoff, 'Let them eat Bits & Bytes', but that is a trademarked name. I listened to Douglas Coupland, who is sounding like a tech party hack more and more, talk about not being able to remember what it was like to not have the Internet. He has a Wired Brain now. And he offered an anecdote to prove it, only the anecdote proved to be vague and flat and unpersuasive (like everything Mr Coupland has written after Generation X).My library has ditched half its collection in the past two years in the naive belief we'll soon be fully digital and want to be fully digital. But the avid readers I know still prefer paper to screens, except when travelling. And though I love my Netflix, streaming is ephemeral with limited selection and brief windows of opportunity. Revolutions, as we know, do not lead to utopian worlds where everyone is free and equal. There's an Orwellian perversity to Tech Rebel's claims that Net Neutrality will bring about an Earthly Paradise when what we really see is a move to One Bookstore, One Taxi Dispatcher, One Encyclopedia, and One Index to the Whole World. The Robber Barons of the Gilded Age have returned and joining them are the Silicon Sultans of the Information Age. And we're called Users, like a drug addict, and yet we are the ones being used. The Bread and Circuses of the Internet keep us entertained while wealth and power becomes concentrated into the hands of a very select few. Aldous Huxley, Douglas Adams, and Neil Postman had it right. We are amusing ourselves to death. And I'm reminded of that scene in Ninotchka where Melvyn Douglas turns on the radio while romancing Greta Garbo and says his radio is 'a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in, they tell you there's a new model out.'Who's watching the smart watchmen?",0.6538,normal

In Beligum, they are given free world class medical care, free education (much more than exists in Canada), social housing, free clothing. What else do they want? At some point we need to wake up. This isn't about some segmented group that needs more cash thrown at it. They received all the benefits of modern welfare society and they still want to kill us. When it was some impoverished farmer in Afghanistan that hated us for drone striking his kids, I could get the left's argument that this drove him to radicalism. These aren't such people in Belgium. They are the people that have been given every possible opportunity by the West, and they still want to kill us due to the indoctrination they receive in their cultural centers and mosques. So I dismiss the author's view that these people are held against their will in some slum without benefits, simply not true. The author is correct that the political and security instability in Belgium allowed radicalism to grow unchecked, but it wasn't for a lack of welfare for these people.

"@portia44 - The story is true... every word, and I CANNOT allow you to publicly call me a liar without defending myself!!!!!My van was white and burgundy; the djellaba I wore was hand-spun and hand-woven with soft, white wool. I was born with plain, white flesh so my head and hands sticking out of the shoulders-to-toes garment were white, too. I am not saying that I was picked on because I was wearing Moroccan clothing and could have been mistaken for a north African, but that is entirely possible. To satisfy political correctness, I will add that the cash payment I received for the van was in Belgian money and not Canadian, but I do clearly recall how much the cash converted to in Canadian funds. The stupid part is that my spouse and I let that police officer cart us around without protesting or making any attempt to escape! He first took us to 'the station' in the back seat of his police car so he could contact the relatives in Canada we named to arrange for plane tickets back (we arrived in Europe with one-way tickets and, after travelling throughout Europe and north Africa for two years, had run out of sufficient funds to buy them so we planned to work in England for awhile). The police officer next escorted us to the car dealership to divest us of our movable home, and then we were taken once more in the back seat of his police car, only to be dumped at the airport to await our flight for hours and hours, until tickets and departure were finally arranged. To this day, I do not know why we quietly acquiesced to his every demand and did not oppose him at all when we were doing nothing wrong and we were not even formally arrested! I suppose we were just frightened, intimidated tourists unaccustomed to criminal or legal trouble in a foreign country, but to this day I feel taken advantage of because I am aware of the cash value of the van.

Given that the students from the 1600s well into the 1900s are mostly dead of old age, that leaves at most 10%, and probably less, of the indian population ever saw the inside of one of these schools.

Wow. It seems commenters here have little knowledge of what is actually going on in FN communities. You want to know why there are issues within families? Well current parents were not raised by parents. They were raised by a residential school system that abused them horribly. How on earth could they learn to be parents? Now they struggle siginficantly with the trauma from their past as well as trying to learn what normal parent-child relationships look like. This is why lots of FN kids are being raised by other family members like grandparents. The systemic racism that is faced by the FN popuation is very real. THe challenges faced by FN youth are also very real.,0.67,normal

"Here's why I think the remainers got wrong against the BREXIT supporters. A lot of the debate were not about addressing the real issues. It was about elites trying to make themselves feel good by explaining how stupid and backwards people who wanted to leave are. In the case of Trump, Michael Moore warned everyone by painting Trump as dangerous, and his fear was most vocalized when he warned his fellow progressives not to attack his followers but to show why Trump is just conning them. Moore sees Trump's supporters as decent people who have legitimate problems that are not being addressed, and attacking them as backwards deplorable irredeemable was the worse strategy possible. But what did the progressives do? They said only stupid racist hateful people support Trump. It was almost like Trump successfully pulled off an Alinsky tactic by baiting the establishment progressives into overreacting and making his supporters even more convinced that he was going to blow the whole place up.I think Moore's plan was difficult to pull off because neither Hillary nor Moore or just about anyone else had the ability to connect to the rust belt and hurting 'deplorables' the same way Trump could --- it's all about people skills. Besides, there was no way Clinton could say that if Ford wanted to move their factory to mexico, she would slap a 35% tarriff when they ship the cars back to the US --- no way Wall Street could tolerate that. But this was EXACTLY what Moore wished she could say.",0.6635,normal

"America has done itself, and the world, an enormous self-inflicted injury. Choices have consequences. At a time when the world is facing aggressive and highly motivated totalitarian powers, and enormous international challenges on climate change, ...... the US has just elected Wendell Wilkie and the America Firsters instead of FDR....It takes a special level of wishful thinking to believe that the leaders of China and Russia, and a host of other unsavory despots, will not take advantage of this terrible error. This result is the outcome of thirty years, and more, of failure to defend the integrity of the institutions of democracy. It matters that Wyoming has the same power in the Senate as California. It matters that old-age mortality is a bigger threat to incumbent congressmen than the ballot box. It matters who sits on the Supreme Court and makes decisions on electoral spending, or on gerrymandered congressional boundaries, or on critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It matters that the fairness standard apply to all electioneering media. It matters that minority voters not have to stand two or three hours in line to vote, or that Greensboro N.C. not have its advanced polling stations cut from 18 to one. It matters that organised religion be kept out of the electoral process - no group has done more to bring this catastrophe about than evangelical Christians, and their obsession with abortion. It matters in a thousand different ways. Polarisation is driven by the deliberate exploitation of the long known weaknesses of first-past-the-post. That ground was prepared and the seeds were planted a long, long time before Donald Trump ever decided to run for office. He is merely an opportunist who jumped to the front of the line, in the right place, and at the right time......Perhaps the Globe will finally understand why electoral reform in general, and most particularly abolition of first-past-the-post, is the most urgent priority.",0.6648,normal

Last week I posted that Donald Trump had a distinct possibility of winning the US election as this was in essence a Brexit USA style vote and the pollsters and media pundits had it wrong. I got the second highest up plus vote on the day on the G&M. For six months I have been saying that the people I knew in the USA felt a distinct disconnect with DC just like the UK had with Brussels. The know it all Liberal Democrats are and were out of touch with the general populace of the 'flyover states' and Main Street USA has spoken. In recent days Obama showed his true colours as an out of touch president who tied his legacy coat tails to a nominee who was flawed in the publics view. Thursday morning will be an interesting meeting at the Whitehouse with Trump viewing the new real estate. I know many businessmen who have had past dealings with Trump and his word is his bond in their words and he is a stand up guy. He will surround himself with advent professionals and will most likely be a great president. His acceptance speech shows that he will now be a committed bridge maker. Chuck Todd of NBC was the only guy last night that got it early last night and spoke about a massive un polled demographic. I look forward to seeing CNNs lead pollster eat a bug on TV today like he said he would if Trump won. Maybe some of these guys should move their offices west of the Hudson to where real people live as Chuck Todd said last night. I have to say that Trudeau showed well thought restraint in not saying anything negative about Trump and there are lots of world leaders in Europe that will have to back track on their public comments. He may not be a great president for Canada but that is not his job. W5 on the weekend showed a great man in the street USA Divided show and it was great journalism diving head long into parts of Ohio that most journalists did not tried.

In a movement it does not matter about the details. You just have to sound right and look right for the mob to follow. Hillary humiliating defeat is entirely by herself. Trump rise to power is completely the result of the failure of not only both parties but presidents since Reagan. One of whom is a war criminal under state protection. With both political parties wiped out, the first shot of the movement already yields a political revolution. The 'swamp' already half drained. His task now is to be a Revolutionary Leader.

"Dear EditorsAt least this is a much more balanced piece than 'the sky is falling' piece you wrote the other day. Here's my view, sitting here in our homeland, not having a vote in the US.Full democracy, allows us all to do and say what we want (short of hatred and racism). My father and uncles, all went to war in WWII to protect that right for all of us today. Most people, in both Canada and the US, have family members who did the same, and some who made the ultimate sacrifice. That America exercised that right yesterday, and other democratic countries have done the same in the past (I am not a fan of Junior Trudeau) is our best strength. As Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”. None of us have an idea how a Trump Presidency will turn out; but the inescapable fact of the matter is that every American, who wanted to exercise their franchise, had the opportunity yesterday to decide who their President is. It wasn’t all that long ago (Aug 6, 1965), that a guy who many people might have expected wouldn’t support universal suffrage, Lyndon Baines Johnson, passed into law for the US, the Voting Rights Act. In 4 years, if they don’t like his performance, they get to kick Trump out of office. In the meantime, everyone who thinks they are “politically entitled” in the US has a chance to rebuild their favourite system. Just as Lech Walesa upset the communist system in Poland, so today has Donald Trump upset the system of political elites in the USA. This is healthy; this is growth; and this will keep America as the leader of the free world. For a country born of revolution, they have nothing to fear. God bless the United States of America.

"This is a good article by Simpson. I especially like the point he makes that neither of the two main opposition parties are likely to roll back the increase in qualifying age for old age pensions from 65 to 67.While the NDP and the Liberals rose up on their hind legs and howled at the moon in pretentious partisan protest at the time, Harper did the right thing and our old age security is still on par with the best in the world. The opposition knows this and is not likely to roll back the qualifying age, in spite of their histrionics to the contrary. I'm at a loss though about his point about the surplus. Small or not a surplus is a surplus and better $1.9 billion surplus than deficit. And as long as the books weren't fudged, which they weren't (although opposition partisans will try to spin that they were) who cares whether the surplus is due to increased revenues or 'careful economic stewardship'.

It would take 80 years of $2 billion surprise surpluses to pay down Harper’s contribution to the national debt.

"I find it hard to believe the author of this article is a university professor. The tone of the piece is self-congratulatory and questionably factual. Important facts are omitted or skewed in the interest of artificially supporting the author’s point and logic fails.“Europe has failed the refugees”....really. Poor Greece has been inundated with refugees that can't afford to help. Germany accepted 140, 000 refugees in 2015 (not just Syrian), Italy and Sweden 30,000 each, France 20,000. Small Denmark was swamped with 20,000 refugee applications. Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Egypt and Iraq have been helping the refugees since the beginning of the crisis (2011). For the most part they permitted Syrians access to their countries and have spent vast amounts of money to support them - some published numbers include Turkey, by the start of December 2014, spent USD 4.5 billion in direct assistance to Syrian and as of mid-2014, tiny Jordan and Lebanon had provided more than US$ 1.2 billion and 1.6 billion respectively. Many refugees are not interested in leaving the region. Millions want to return home once the war is over and would prefer to stay close to home - little interest was shown in immigrating to Canada when they were questioned last year. And as for complaints by the author that “More than 1,000 of the newcomers are living in temporary housing. And we still have a shortage of family doctors, a lack of proper dental care for low-income adults and a lack of subsidized daycare spaces for parents who want to learn English”. How does that differ from the plight faced by many Canadians? Should refugees be somehow afforded a higher priority than citizens? And the comment “University-age refugees, or those who already have foreign degrees, can’t afford our postsecondary system, sending many to low-income jobs instead. What future do refugees have without proper language training, Canadian education or Canadian work experience” pretty much sums up why the refugees don’t want to come to Canada or complain when they get here. Resettlement of refugees is a complex, time consuming undertaking and resource intensive. How is Canada supposed to magically change this experience?

Nowhere on earth can millions of people cross an isthmus to existing host towns ... where they do not share the values of the hosts ... and demand to be taken in at the expense of the hosts. Demand housing, demand health & dental care, demand education, demand recognition for credentials at face value, demand childcare ... who is paying for all this? Hint: not the refugees. This is a smack in the face to all Canadians, particularly those who never thought it was a good idea to bring these huge families to Canada, preferring to send those funds (for flights to Canada and costly accommodation here) to refugee settlements in Jordan and other zones close to Syria.

Even Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States do NOT accept refugees, even though they are member states of the UN.I suspect it is this pushy demanding attitude that leads to problems in the Middle East, along with the unsustainable growth in population.

The head tax, the race riots of 1907, the internment of Japanese Canadians (a Federal decision hugely influenced by BC politicians) - followed by the restriction of Japanese Canadians from returning (and even voting) until 1948. It's also pretty fair to say that there is a component of racism in the criticisms of rising housing prices with all Chinese being painted by the same brush. Read some of the comments in stories about BC real estate to see examples - it's pretty overt from certain posters. Even the CRA's lame excuse that they didn't want to be accused of racism by doing their jobs is pathetic - reverse racism. (Note: I don't believe this excuse for a second.

So why has Canada been tasked with the responsibility as a safe haven for Chinese nationals, and their money, at the expense of Canadians, Canadian tax payers, and the quality of our lives? 3) The Citizens of Vancouver and of Canada, in general, are what gives these properties their value. We are a fair and equal society where human rights and the rule of law rein. We are not bogged down by corruption, government suppression nor a vast indifference to each other. We have dialogue and free speech, open government and democratic institutions, and an enormous acceptance and healthy curiosity for what is different. Our behaviour gives these properties value!

"While your conclusion that Ms. Clinton lost the election because she is a woman may be valid, I think you're over-distilling a complex set of issues into a simple gender issue. Remember, Mr. Trump chewed his way through 16 other Republican contenders, most of them men, and probably all of them technically more qualified than he. Much of that spectacle occurred long before it was evident that Ms. Clinton would be the Democratic nominee. You assume, incorrectly, that America is a progressive society. While there are progressive segments, what this election demonstrated is the opposite. Sexism, racism and xenophobia are alive and doing very well there, particlarly in the Republican caucus. Further, politics is relentlessly self-serving, at the personal and party level. Also, especially since 2008, economic growth has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy. (That's a big issue on its own, but its relevance here is that the privileged are making the economic and political decisions to their own benefit while the underclass is falling farther behind.) For example, how can America's election campaign funding model be considered fair and democratic? Mr. Trump has ably exploited all these issues. Ms. Clinton, besides being a woman, also became the poster-person for the status quo. In effect her biggest asset - her vast experience - became a liability. Perhaps Bernie Sanders would have been a better adversary, not because he's a guy, but because he also was speaking out about the injustices being suffered by less privileged Americans. Those arguments worked very well for his popularity too, particularly among young women. And, since we're here, Ms. Clinton wasn't so overwhelmingly popular among those younger women. While one can argue with some validity that some women are against a female President, I'd venture that for many of them, other issues are in play. While it is fair to speak out against sexism (and racism and xenophobia) in America and elsewhere, my worry now is that Americans have elected a sorcerer's apprentice. How much damage can this apprentice do? I worry about increasing instability in eastern Europe (in particular). I worry about war over the South China Sea. I worry that the global ecosphere is in deeper trouble now, due to Mr Trump's inappropriate policies on climate change, habitat destruction and unsustainable, profit-driven, wasteful consumption of resources.

"I'm going to tell my daughter that in the US, according to a massive, detailed analysis of decades of elections at all levels, there is no statistically significant difference in a woman's likelihood of being elected when running for office. I'm going to tell my daughter what I told the two demoralized young female cashiers at the grocery store: That having watched Hillary's career for 20 years, having looked at her major donors (monied interests), having read some of the leaked emails, having looked at her positions regarding due process for accused men, having read accounts from former staff (from SS to aides to housekeepers) that she has a hair trigger temper and a habit of domestic violence and abuse of underlings, I would never have voted for her. Not in a million years. I'd have voted in Peewee Herman over her. I'm going to tell my daughter that having a vagina does not make someone a good person, that being a skilful rhetorician doesn't necessarily make what someone says valid, and that being diplomatic and a convincing liar doesn't make a person honest. I'm going to tell my daughter that being sad because a woman didn't get in this time is silly, and I'll point her to some genuine examples of women who achieved great things and never sacrificed their honor or principles to do so, and never had to play 'the vagina card'--people like Anne Cools, Erin Pizzey, Karen Decrow, and even Marie Henein. I'll tell my daughter that when Marie Henein spoke with Peter Mansbridge about her defence of Jian Ghomeshi, I watched the video ten times, transfixed by her adherence to the principles of law, of justice, of due process, of presumption of innocence, of the right to a vigorous defence, and her awareness of the power of the state to utterly destroy the lives of people, innocent or not, if it is allowed to act without constraint. And I'll tell her about all the feminist women who declared Marie Henein to be a 'traitor to her gender' for the crime of doing her job passionately and competently, and that it's this same mentality that has convinced some women that the results of this election are proof of misogyny. I don't care about whether Hillary's a good mother, or whether she held her grandbaby enough. I don't care about whether she's 'cuddly'. I care about her competency, her honesty and her integrity, and from more than 20 years of observing her actions, I found her lacking. She's a corrupt career politician who's in the pocket of monied interests, who has been irresponsible with classified information, whose inaction has led to deaths, and who only seems to be good at courting massive donations from foreign dictatorships and the banking elite, and commanding speaking fees in the hundreds of thousands, all while claiming to be the voice of ordinary American women.

"I completely agree with Henein when she writes, “The problem is bigger than Mr. Trump”. While I find Trump to be completely abhorrent, in essence, he has only served to reflect a society that is deeply divided and very frustrated. He has served to illuminate and give a platform to misogynistic, racist & isolationist/nationalist idealism. It is a frightening state of affairs here in America. That said, Hillary Clinton DID win the popular vote. One of the biggest problems in America is the electoral college. Now, twice in recent history, two extremely qualified candidates have lost the election b/c of the electoral college: Hillary Clinton & Al Gore. We need to let the people’s true voices be heard. We need to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral college. It was established by the founding fathers of America to ensure equal representation for each state, but it is now completely antiquated and detrimental to America. In fact, I can think of a few constitutional amendments that need to be abolished …starting with the 2nd amendment!!! (But, I digress)2) I somewhat agree with Henein when she writes, “She lost because she was a woman”. While I agree that it was one of the factors, I certainly did not vote for Hillary b/c she was a woman and I hope no one else did either! I voted for Hillary b/c I have the utmost respect for her 30 years of public service, her balanced thoughtful approach to making decisions and b/c she is the most qualified candidate to have EVER run for the highest office in America! In fact, it frustrated me when Hillary kept referring to “the glass ceiling”. While I understand that it is not the case right now, every women should be judged on her merit alone….not the color of her pantsuit. I am confident that within our lifetime we will be addressing a “Madam President”. Why? ...Because we are raising woman that BELIEVE they CAN be president.

Lindsay is Canadian and the Head of Sport Psychophysiology for the USOC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHMO91TvY2Y Dr. Penny Werthner was the Head of Sport Psych at U of Ottawa, and this year became the Head of Kinesiology at University of Calgary. Both are gifted, with Gold Medal Results. They are the pinnacle of Sport Psychology, and are at the Vatican University, showing Canadian Accomplishment!

"Innovation is the critical component to improving our lives, whether for basic information technology or health and well being. Canada is almost trailing the industrial world in the use of electronic health records and our joy of waging war on drug companies keeps us in the last quartile of pharmaceutical innovation because we can't afford the cost of risk, research and development. It appears we enjoy adopting some technology at a fast pace but we assume the barrier to other technologies, primarily controlled by government, are not as important.",1,normal

"The fact it measure heart rate, blood pressure, etc is what worries me the most. This could very well be one more step in the march towards big brother. Insurance companies will love that they can retrieve this information when making policy decisions, on signing them and paying them.",1,normal
"The Smart Watch will help people with blood pressure and heart ailments to monitor their vital signs but, unfortunately for the rest of us, it wont cure Ms. Renzetti's myopia. Ms. Renzetti uses a Blackberry. Perhaps she can remember back to 'the good old days' before mobile phones were invented when she used a land line. She wouldn't have seen the need or use for mobile phones either. Ms. Renzetti doesn't need to change the thermostat from across the room but a person with mobility issues and living alone would find it a blessing. The new LED light bulbs will replace incandescent bulbs not because 'invention is the mother of necessity' but because the 'necessity is the mother of invention'. The bulbs reduce power consumption by over 85% saving all of us big $$$, including Ms. Renzetti.",1,normal
Except the city never charged anyone $200k for a taxi license. The fact that these have such a value on the secondary market should be irrelevant to the city. What that secondary market value really suggests is the system is completely broken. The barrier to entry is unreasonable and unjustifiable.,1,normal
"Alexander Slimnich +1 , and I will add, because the secondary market is demanding 100's of thousands, and this was a steady increase over the years, given it is a ""market"", it can also fall and demand much less. This has always been a risk, particularly since Uber has been known and around for years.",1,normal
"Never surprised How would that be fair? No one paid 200k to the city for those licenses, did they? ---------- SOME DID a taxi licence plate is very expensive check with a taxi company",1,normal
"At most the city should buy back all exisitng licences for the cost it currently charges for a new licence, 4.5 grand, less admin fee. That is the most the city should compensate licence holders for, because that is the actual cost of a licence! Then, as the globe said the city should simply charge all drivers a yearly permit where they also have to show car maintenance and insurance. Done. This should be like 100 or so.",1,normal
"tempsperdue 13 minutes ago At most the city should buy back all exisitng licences for the cost it currently charges for a new licence, 4.5 grand, less admin fee. -------- are we talking a TAXI LICENCE PLATE there is a quota supply and demand I would like to see you walk in to City hall and buy one for $4,500",1,normal

Yes to Uber. No to taxi cartels.'-------------------No to Uber Corporation?,1,normal
"They dictate meter rates because, as the article states, they have created an oligopoly and an artificial shortage of taxis. If they didn't dictate prices under the current system, rates would be sky high. What the city needs to get out of is the restriction in the number of taxis and to allow more competition. THAT would help tremendously.",1,normal
"Uber drivers have filed a class action lawsuit claiming they have been misclassified as independent contractors and are entitled to be reimbursed for their expenses that Uber should have to pay, like for gas and vehicle maintenance. The lawsuit also challenges Uber’s practice of telling passengers that the gratuity is included and not to tip the drivers, even though you are not getting a tip!! We won a major victory on March 11, 2015, when the judge overseeing the case, Judge Edward M. Chen, of the federal district court in San Francisco, denied Uber’s motion for summary judgment! In his decision, the judge agreed with many of our arguments about why Uber drivers may be properly classified as employees. Click here to read the court’s decision. Under the court’s order, the case will go to trial before a jury. See the news stories below for reports on the ruling. The next step in the case will now be for the court to decide class certification, which would define the scope of the case and which drivers can be covered under it. The court has set a hearing on class certification for August 6, 2015. We expect that Uber will argue that most drivers are bound by an arbitration clause, which prevents them from benefiting from a class action case in court. In another case (which challenges Uber’s background checks), the same judge who is presiding over our case ruled that Uber’s arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable. However, Uber has appealed that decision. In the event that the arbitration clause is ultimately enforced, we plan to file individual arbitration cases for drivers who may be bound by the arbitration clause. So if you did not opt out of Uber's arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting the agreement (and most drivers did not), please CONTACT US so that we can add you to our list of drivers to pursue individual arbitration if we need to do that, so that you can be assured of being covered by the result we obtain. If you accepted an Uber contract within the last 30 days, you can still opt out of the arbitration clause by emailing optout@uber.com and saying you want to opt out of the arbitration clause. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF WE WIN THE CASE, YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANYTHING FROM IT UNLESS YOU CONTACT US TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION. SO PLEASE EMAIL ELIZABETH LOPEZ, AT elopez@llrlaw.com, TO SIGN UP FOR ARBITRATION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO FILE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS FOR DRIVERS. MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRIVERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED US TO JOIN OUR LIST. In a recent decision, the California Labor Commissioner ruled that an Uber driver was indeed an employee, not an independent contractor, and ordered Uber to reimburse the driver for her expenses. This is the same remedy we are seeking for all Uber drivers in the class action lawsuit. This decision was a great result and may be helpful to our lawsuit. We were very pleased to learn that the California Labor Commissioner agrees that Uber is acting as an employer. However, Uber has appealed the decision, which will be reviewed de novo in court, and so its impact on the class action case is not yet clear. We filed this case on behalf of Uber drivers across the country. In an early ruling, the court agreed with us that the case could proceed on behalf of drivers nationwide. In a later ruling, however, the judge changed his mind and limited the case to drivers in California. We think this decision was incorrect and we plan to appeal it. But meanwhile, if you have driven for Uber anywhere in the United States, and did not opt out of the arbitration clause within 30 days of accepting Uber’s licensing agreement, PLEASE CONTACT US to obtain a form to return to us so that we can pursue an individual arbitration claim for you, in the event that we have to pursue these claims individually, rather than through the class action. If you have any questions, feel free to call or email Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lead attorney representing the Uber drivers, or her paralegal assistant, Elizabeth Lopez, at (617) 994-5800, at elopez@llrlaw.com, or sliss@llrlaw.com.Attorney Liss-Riordan and her firm have represented thousands of tipped employees, and employees who have been misclassified as independent contractors, all around the country.

'Yes to Uber. No to taxi cartels.' -- G&M Editorial. Bang on!,1,normal
"While the cartels limit competition within our borders, the extra dough they make here, makes it easier for them to sell their services at an even lower price outside our borders. The companies within our oligopolies are quite successful abroad. On the back of over paying Canadians to boot.",1,normal
"Canada simply loves cartels, from milk to cheese to poultry to taxis to telecommunications, the list is endless. And this lack of competition not only hurts all citizens but in the end it severely damages our competitiveness in the global economy by constantly putting us behind the 8 ball. Toronto should do as Santiago Chile did in the 80's, and that is to open up the taxi market by stripping the government red tape for licenses and making it much cheaper and easier for those who want to drive. At first there was a predictable explosion of taxis on the streets in Santiago, but over a relatively short period of time the market itself dictated the amount of taxis that would survive. In other words, the free market found its natural and proper equilibrium. Uber is too good a service to ignore, it's here to stay. So let's be smart and not restrict it for the sake of protecting some tired old dinosaurs.",1,normal
The most sensible and practical editorial I have read in a long long time.,1,normal
"Either way, that's irrelevant. Does anyone expect to see the same cabbie day after day? Or even to see them ever again? Nope. The obnoxious colour they paint their cars is the only thing that bears any continuity for a paying customer. Beyond that, they get into a Camry one day, a Crown Vic another, one is maintained and clean, another is a falling apart jalopy. Their drivers come and go too. That is just not a selling point.",1,normal
"Your editorial hints at this, but it should be made explicit: the major component of the price to a customer of taking a licensed cab in Toronto is that of paying a large rent on the taxi licence plate attached to the car. Remove that unnecessary and costly restriction and the price to the public can be reduced significantly, as well as supply increased. Improved customer service and convenience also follow. It's a win-win for customers, and also for public transit for that matter since taxi service is considered to be part of public transit.",1,normal
"another lost soul,, not to worry, lots of lawyers in Toronto, and perhaps as early as next spring, you too may understand what we have been trying to tell our government about Uber,",1,normal
"At $80 for a 20 min cab ride (just using the figures provided), that works out to $240/hr. Now, of course, there are legitimate and reasonable costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and operating the vehicle which need to be accounted for, but that comes out to nowhere near $240/hr. The problem with the current system is there are a small number of people earning a lot of money for doing little/no work for it. Cut out these middle men (who provide no actual value to the system) and fares can be lowered while drivers earn a reasonable wage.",1,normal
"I am willing to bet that the G&M will never give us the real story on Uber,",1,normal
"I am at Yonge and 7, a 20 minute drive along the 407 to the Airport costs me 80 bucks. Gas is cheaper these days, 407 is around 5 bucks, they are making way too much money. The cartel has had it good for a long time, we need competition and we need it now.",1,normal
Some people need to create and open source Uber-like app. Hopefully it will catch on and we'll see how much the people who run Uber really like the 'sharing' economy.,1,normal
"Everyone wants that but where is the expense part? The UBER organization covers all of that while your standard taxi does not. This is simply a level of care, like having a clean car!",1,normal
Well neither Uber nor the Taxi companies offer that right now. Not in Toronto they don't. Not reliably or with any consistency.,1,normal
"I want regulated drivers who must meet a standard of competence, personal reliability, and reputation driving regulated vehicles that must be clean and well maintained. I don't want anyone who does not comply with driver and vehicle standards to offer a transportation service. I want to be able to put a child in a vehicle, send them off to a destination and feel safe. THAT is the litmus test. If you think that's unrealistic, you are not making reasonable demands of the system. Will it be expensive? Sure.",1,normal
"How is it possible,,, has everyone been hypnotized, The only monopoly I see is that Uber can do as they wish, without consequences currently,,,, Uber drivers are driving without any insurance,, and tax fraud,,, no HST,,, who know if they are even claiming income from it,,, According to the G&M an Uber driver makes a 1000 a week net in a brand new car,,, Really how can the public be so gullible,,,",1,normal
"wow,,,, well put - LOL,,,, Cartel,,,,, OMG,, what nonsense next,,",1,normal
"Why do they need to be compensated? Technology has changed the market conditions. When that happens something that once had value might not in the future. If you purchase a house or stock in an oil company, you are not guaranteed its value in perpetuity. These people made a speculative investment and are now trying to suggest it was a guarantee. I don't suspect that the city ever made any guarantees about the value of taxi plates.",1,normal
"I suspect that a lot of the people who are suggesting that we throw the doors open would be talking out the other side of their mouths, if they had purchased licenses, assuming that they actually mean something. That is not to say that we shouldn't allow Uber, but just that we need to be fair to the people who played by the existing rules. If we are going to throw open the market, they need to be compensated.",1,normal
"Most drivers do not own the taxi plate ....they lease the car from the car owner... who either owns the plate....or rents the plate from the plate owner. Drivers also must pay for fuel....dispatch fees... and many times... have to pay a fee for CC machines, and each transaction .At the end of the day/night shift, after paying for all the added on costs.....the actual driver keeps only a fraction of what the meter reads....Uber....is as safe as any other taxi.. but they don't pay all those added on costs that the cab companies' drivers must pay",1,normal
"Not a fan of Uber, sliding scale rates, lack of regulation re someone taking me somewhere, etc. However, that's my opinion. This editorial states there aren't enough cabs in the city - a rather glaring mistake. Possibly in outlying areas it may take longer to get a cab, but that would be true of Uber as well. But I don't appreciate the media trying to make up my mind for me by providing misinformation.",1,normal
"“What we need is one bylaw that applies without question to everybody,” he said. “We cannot have the Wild West, but we also cannot have a city that in some way ignores the march of technology and time.”=====================================================Mayor Tory has it right. The problem has arisen due to the totally different treatment the two sectors of the taxi service are subject to. Governments like regulation & collecting money and Uber doesn't allow them to do that.",1,normal
"The license has nothing to do with almost any argument,,, it is simply distracting you from the real truth,,, Uber drivers have no insurance,, they neither collect or pay HST as they are required by law, there are 83 more by-laws, cameras, safety issues overcharging,,, that Uber is not regulated are we kidding ourselves,,, getting in a car with no insurance is enough to stop me,,",1,normal
This would only be fair if all the people who paid ridiculous amounts for their taxi licences in the past were reimbursed by the city. Changing the ground rules without recognizing what was paid by long-time owners in the past would not be just.,1,normal
"You can easily get an answer to Uber insurance question by checking the website, it's not so hard to fact check but alas most complainers prefer fantasy to reality.",1,normal
"I agree with the need to end the cartel, the artificial rationing of taxi licenses and the re-sale of existing licenses. And I don't care what brings the car to me . . . a fancy phone app, a phone call or smoke signals. But when that car arrives, I have a right to know that the driver is adequately licensed to transport passengers for hire, that the car has passed a commercial safety inspection, that the car and driver carry adequate commercial insurance and that the driver has been screened and is not a known sex offender, drug user or dangerous criminal.",1,normal
"Because you can't just go to city hall and get a license to operate a cab company like you would for a pet license, drivers license, etc. The supply of these licenses is artificially restricted, and that's a huge part of the problem. City hall needs to get out of the way and allow the free market to take over. For sure, they can set reasonable standards to prevent abuses - and some of the tactics of uber, like surge pricing during a terrorist attack certainly are abusive - but these standards need not include an artificial limit on the number of taxis on the road.",1,normal
"Oh I don't know. If you ride in Toronto taxis, you will find a few foreign doctors out there.",1,normal
"@peter1215... you are correct. The tribunal has nothing to do with UN and UN has clarified this in its website. The author of this articles, as many other journalists too, has apparently made a mistake or not well informed about the fact.",1,normal
"The document it is arbitrating on IS a UN document. Nice try though, wu mao",1,normal
"Professor Burton mistakenly stated the tribunal in The Hague is UN-backed, it is not. The Permanent Court of Arbitration (or the tribunal) bears no relationship with UN. The PCA is not the International Court of Justice (the PCA is not a court in the traditional sense; it is only a special tribunal). The ICJ is the judicial organ of the United Nations. A lot of people thought the PCA is the same as the ICJ. Due to the confusion, the United Nations was forced to clarify four weeks ago that the tribunal is not UN's legislative institution and the ICJ 'has had no involvement' in the South China Sea case. The PCA bears no relationship with the UN.US, UK, France and Russia, all permanent members of the UN Security Council have routinely rejected the PCA' ruling for the past 20 years. I do not think its ruling is binding.",1,normal

"'The proposal has strong resonance in China domestically, as it would show Beijing fulfilling Mao’s mandate. 'It also resonates strongly with overseas Chinese, no matter how long have they lived in the Western liberal society. Some of them seemingly quite integrate into our free speech, free election and liberal society. But when it comes to the old motherland, hot blood boil immediately, there is no discussion especially when it comes to South China Sea and Japan. Any Chinese says something different, they will be shunned and shut down. Under the new Chinese imperial strategy (the Chinese now behaves the same as the Western imperialists they used to condemn), Canada would get a short end of the stick when we negotiate any trade deal. If we think otherwise, we are gullible.",1,normal

"I have a lapdog, he barks every time the big dog next door does. so annoying.",1,normal
I don't quite understand why American need any allies when their defense budget is more than top xx military spending countries combined. It makes no sense in real war term unless you use it to control those 'allies'. They are totally useless since it is not WW2 time. Chinese think it is quite laughable when American cry for allies in Asia when facing China. It means you're so weak to hide behind someone else. And Chinese understand perfectly none of them can be put to a real fight. Allies are just BS in today's world.,1,normal
Everything they manufacture was invented and originally built in Western Countries. Manufacturers moved there to take advantage of low wages and lack of environmental and health and safety regulations. China could be driven back into penury by some nice stiff import tariffs imposed by the English speaking countries.,1,normal
A nice 50% tariff imposed on Chinese imports entering the USA and Canada would work wonders.,1,normal
"Boy it's hard to begin a refutation on Charles petty little lies and hypocrisy. An agent of the CIA and the Pentagon, America's Great War Machine, he is most definitely. A dispute between China, Taiwan, Vietnam and others on the extent of their respective sovereignty in the S. China Sea dates back to end of WW2, but originated around 1900. It's been a century of on/off squabbles, their own affairs. But when Hillary became SoS a few years ago she proclaimed with great hubris Asia Pivot! What this means is the U.S. will install massive military forces in the region to contain & control China. And thus the Obama regime inserted itself into this century old affair, made it America's business, to cover the real goal of Asia domination. To meddle in this adventure and see what come out of it just like Syria. And if its war so much the better. The design is classic but most evil. Nobody like to be 'contained' and China responded. [I like to see America being 'contained' one day and enjoy to see how it jumps and cries like a bullied child.]The so-called Tribunal is not a UN-sponsored body. It is just an opinion body in a far away European country with absolutely no court power. It deals only with economic matters, not politics or border. Philippines previous president asked it to pass an opinion on the matter of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), not border or sovereignty. Specifically, what size of an island qualified for EEZ. The Tribunal reports that NO island or sandbar or reclaimed islands currently in the SCS qualify for EEZ. It also defined what size will qualify. That's it. No islands built or claimed by all parties - China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia is an EEZ and therefore not a basis for border. That's the opinion for this body. The meaning is simply that they can build bigger islands to fit the EEZ definition, or just go sit down and work out a border solution. China is willing to talk but not with the U.S. inserting itself in the matter. The new Philippine president agreed and they will begin the talk. Once they formed a framework others may join to effect a solution. This of course is very bad news for American war mongers and Asian Pivoters. What would they do without the excuse to insert even more massive forces than they currently have in the region, to ensure there is a Vietnam War 2.0 to match Cold War 2.0 in Europe? Thus you have CIA puppet like Charles writing this article in desperation.",1,normal
"Looks like it. When it comes to one's portfolio, sovereignty takes on less meaning, something that the late Mel Hurtig failed to point out. He was not a socialist.

"Teddy Roosevelt instructed the admiral of the U.S. naval force sitting outside Manila Bay to be prepared to blow up the Spanish navy sitting in the harbour.

Then Teddy resigned his position as under-secretary, formed up his Roughriders cavalry unit and rode up San Juan Hill. The rest is history........which you should really read in depth sometime. MM .

"There are some errors in this column. The Permanent Court of Arbitration is a private organization and has nothing to do with the UN. The UN has no position on the Philippines vs China case. There is no international consensus on the South China Sea ruling. So far only the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Philippines, and Vietnam has said the case was binding. All other countries have released statements exhorting the importance of UNCLOS and the need for a peaceful settlement. If it comes to military force, then China will crush the Philippines navy in a couple of days. The Philippines navy is the weakest in Asia with obsolete boats and little fuel and ammunition. China has continuously called for peaceful negotiation with the Philippines and other countries. The new Philippines President, Rodrigo Duterte, seems to want negotiation with China as he wants Chinese investment in infrastructure.",1,normal
"Under the Obama administration, our allies no longer trust us (Israel in particular) and our enemies no longer respect or fear us. It is that simple.

"Nope, the immigrants have turned to organized crime. Think the Italian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Latino Cartels, etc. This happens because the immigrants have a hard time finding regular jobs due to discrimination. As for terrorism, diasporas are often involved due to their inflated patriotism. In Canada we have seen Irish/Sikh/Tamil/Islamic terrorists living here. There have also been the FLQ, communists, and other ideological terrorists (who I don't know a lot about).",1,normal

"Exactly. I went to school with many immigrants.

These immigrants aren't dumb. They came to inflict terror and that's it. It didn't just happen because they live in a ghetto.

I think everyone can agree that dumping a bunch of ill-prepared foreigners into suburban European ghettos is a bad idea, but that shouldn't minimize the agency and autonomy of those individuals. Radicalization, while pernicious, is a ultimately a choice; Islamic terrorism is not simply the product of bad immigration policies.

They have also attacked in the US several times and tried in Canada. They have also (mostly) attacked in Muslim countries against fellow Muslims. We need to stop trying to blame socio economic factors. These certainly contribute to the problem but are not the source. The use/misuse of the Islamic religion is the source.

"@Informed Albertan - I went to your National Post comment, ""Dedicated prayer rooms at odds with secular schools"" (2011) and I would like to respond: First, this is an article about Ontario provincial policies.

I have already experienced the stripping of religious artifacts in classrooms years ago, when I lived in Ontario. Although my early years were spent starting the day with the Christian ""Lord's Prayer"" and celebrating ""Christmas,"" schools I later attended ceased any connection with any religion. Out of respect for the growing diversity of religions emerging in Ontario, only a photograph of the Queen was hung on the walls; no crosses, Bibles, genuflecting, crossing oneself or religious songs remained in the classroom. Why should Islam be excepted and treated differently than Christianity? If religion is left at home, a great deal of social conflict will be avoided.",1,normal

I think DSR raises a valid concern. I can see Canada becoming hyper regional under proportional representation. AB and SK and interior BC form a voting block. Ontario stands alone and votes Liberal. Quebec has their own interest. The Maritimes elect the Increase the Dole party. Nothing would ever get done. Canada exists because we're forced to compromise between the main parties and those parties have to form big tents of various regional interests. That'd be the case no more under prop rep.,1,normal

In short, Brussels is the shining light of left-wing big government. And yet all of this government cannot protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. The politicians and bureaucrats will deny responsibility while claiming that they need more money (i.e., higher taxes) to fund improved security. The reality, however, is misplaced priorities and too much money spent by bureaucrats on activities that are unproductive and unimportant.

"This is absolutely tragic. The call to get premiers to deal with this when natives have stated repeatedly that they don't want us involved in their affairs is not an effective solution. If the natives wish self determination it is certainly and absolutely up to them to resolve this issue. Outsiders have attempted to help in the past with no or poor results. In fact, our society at one time performed experiments on native children. We have also 'taken' children from their home and those results were poor at best. The issue can be resolved at the family level. And that is where the change must start. A warm loving home is certainly preferable to the mean streets of any city. And the streets are mean, even in the most progressive of societies. And if a child is led to believe that the streets are better than home, there is a problem in the home.

They need to join with the rest of Canadians in building a strong Canada. To give up special status and living on reserves with outdated systems of governance. They always demand self government but when problems arise it is never their fault. Come join in with the rest of us instead of your self imposed apartheid (a policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race).",1,normal
"Great job identifying the self obvious problems with abuse of native women and children but a failing grade on proposing solutions. The big picture is that we will have increasing native social problems as long as the reserve system of segregation remains. It always surprises me to see otherwise intelligent people prepared to tinker around the edges of native ills but never suggest the whole system is broken and that Native leadership are the prime drivers of maintaining the status quo. Visit a reserve, see for yourself the conditions and then tell me how a people who are dependent on a band and council for everything without any expectation of personal responsibility for ones living can work. Time for a change, become Canadian, get a job, pay taxes. This is the solution but will never happen as long as the native segregation exists.",1,normal
"After reading Ms Turpel-lafond's article, I'm not sure what she is actually asking for. My personal experience living across the street from a reserve is that many of the problems are internal. I watched an 11 or 12 year old girl be sexually assaulted by an older male reserve member and when I called the police, they said they could only attend the reserve if someone on the reserve called. So I stood there in the rain, yelling at the man who had assaulted the young girl and he told me to mind my own business and go away. From my perspective, no amount of money will make the problem of abuse of young girls go away until the attitude on the reserves changes. Last week there was an article in the Globe titled 'The best native leader Canada never had.' It profiled Chief Clarence Louie of the Osoyoos band. Unless there has been no residential school abuse of his band, what is the difference between his band and all the other bands? It seems it is a lack of leadership. Yes, I want this awful abuse to stop happening, but throwing more money at the problem doesn't seem to be the answer. It has to be a change of culture within each individual band. I've met some really strong native women who know what needs to be done, but they are being undermined by a bad, sexist culture on the reserves. Tossing dollars at the problem won't help. So Ms. Turpel-Lafond, give us something more concrete call to action that just another inquire. And please tell me why the Osoyoos band works when others do not.",1,normal
"The last report on abuse of aboriginal women that I read indicated that some 80% of physical (and sexual) abuse of young aboriginal women was committed by aboriginal men, mostly family members.

"I'm sure there are strong women in each of the reserves. I think it's time the women who live on-reserve form their own support groups to help each other with a multitude of different aspects of raising children. After all, as mentioned on this forum, it is the grandmothers and great aunts who are raising the children - and these women would have gone through the residential school system themselves. Not all residential school experiences were bad, some were thankful to be away from their disfunctional families. Most of the reserves have a medical nurse - are they totally overwhelmed or could they be a resource before the fact rather than after the fact for what takes place on the reserve. The women who live off-reserve have more resources and non-profit groups to turn to for support and help. Those on reserve probably do not. However, it would seem that help is really not wanted from non-native people, but we gget blamed for all the problems. Women - stand up for your children - male or female!!",1,normal

Mr. Hughes draws a connection? More like states the obvious. Which is why an inquiry is not needed. There is nothing to figure out.

"Sounds like Professor Yu is using the 'race card' because it is used to play Canadian politicians like harps. Professor Yu makes no mention of all the other nations in the world that use 'foreign investment taxes' to ensure globe-trotting foreigners don't hoover up housing stock that could house 'stay-put' citizens. He makes NO mention of China's very restrictive land ownership policies, something that is done to protect real estate for domestic citizens ... and no one calls China 'racist' for doing that. Even the Chinese Ambassador to Canada blamed Canada for not taking steps to control its domestic real estate market. I'm getting rather tired of the convenient use of the 'race lens' everywhere INSIDE Canada because it doesn't play very well elsewhere. Canada is not perfect, but it is probably one of the least racist nations ... except when it comes to First Nations who tend to have been restricted by government decree until recent years. The following article from 2013 tells us that more than half of Toronto's population is NON-white (the target of authors who favour a 'race lens') -- same in Vancouver?: http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/a-fascinating-new-map-of-torontos-ethnic-distribution/ It also identifies the primary source countries for immigration as the Philippines, India, and China. What are the current populations of the primary source nations for Canadian immigrants? As of June 30, 2015, China had the largest population at 1.362 billion followed by India at 1.252 billion with the Philippines coming in at 100, 699,000. Populations of various nations can be found at http://populationpyramid.net/world/2015/ If we are going to talk about skin colour as if it is the DEFINING point for a nation, let’s be completely honest about the place of white skin (a 'trick' of melanin contained in all human skins) in the world. White is the true minority colour in this global human mix. Canada receives large numbers of immigrants from homogeneous nations where being white is a rarity; yet, Canada is home to a very mixed population of 35,939,000. Within the context of world populations (particularly immigrant source nations), the number of 'white' people is miniscule. Many parts of Canada are trying to 'resemble' the populations of the entire world. Yet, NOWHERE ELSE in the world does that happen. Immigrant source nations are certainly NOT trying to resemble Canada, or attract ‘white’ people because they feel they MUST be more ‘diverse’, though 'Homo sapiens sapiens' simply describes the entire human race as ONE single species. What's up with the 'race lens' that is supposed to be applied uniquely and ONLY in Canada? I think Professor Yu knows better.",1,normal
"i'm all for measures to curb offshore speculators (and even those who, like Kenny Gu, who are now landed immigrants), but this politically motivated tax might well be called the BC libs' 'boomerang' tax... coming to bite them in the as$ for their hypocritical flipflopping via Jing Li in a civil class suit. seems David Eby had a more sound approach, also echoed by UBC school of business. http://www.vancourier.com/news/ndp-housing-critic-slams-premier-s-affordable-rental-announcement-1.2348306excerpt:''Eby said the government needs to fix the foreign buyers tax, which he called poorly conceived and designed to avoid bad headlines, to make sure it doesn’t have to pay the money back and it also needs to make a long-term commitment to a multi-year housing plan with targets for numbers of units.“Because this ad hoc political approach to housing hasn’t worked,” he said. Eby wants the government to adopt the Sauder School of Business proposal to tax people who don’t live, work and pay taxes in British Columbia with an extra property tax, which would be collected every year “and would provide sustainable and ongoing funding for housing and would also capture all the money that’s already in the housing market and would avoid the constitutional problem that their tax has.”- See more at: http://www.vancourier.com/news/ndp-housing-critic-slams-premier-s-affordable-rental-announcement-1.2348306#sthash.z2qLoP2D.dpuf",1,normal

"The author is off base and his article is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. This tax is nothing like the head tax. First, it is not Canada wide as was the case with the head tax. Second, all foreigners, including Chinese, are able to enter this country and live here without paying this tax by renting a property. Third, the tax is not exclusive to Chinese as the head tax was. Although Chinese are most affected by the tax, there are plenty of American film and software workers moving here who are also affected. Last year was a record year for film and TV. Microsoft, EA Sports, Dreamworks and many others are big employers in Vancouver, and many are expanding. Finally, many other countries have similar restrictions or taxes - Switzerland and Thailand are two that come to mind. If the author thinks that this is racist, he should be calling out China. It has had nationwide restrictions since 2006, where foreigners can only own one property for personal use, and then only after living in the country for a year. There are also legislated restrictions on the ability of foreigners to get a mortgage. Contrast this with the ability of Chinese who are non resident in Canada, who are able to theoretically buy hundreds of houses, with no restrictions on a bank lending them money - if they pay the tax.",1,normal
I notice the author doesn't answer his own question. Probably because the answer is clearly NO. A yes answer would be indefensible so he would rather leave it unanswered an imply that maybe it is yes. It is clearly no because it applies to all foreigners and it is clearly no because Chinese Canadians do not have to pay it. I expect better from a UBC Prof than attempting to stir up racial grevances.,1,normal
What a strange article. It seemed more like a lecture on the history of Chinese mistreatment from previous generations of Canadians. It is opinion but missed the point of the tax here in Vancouver.

Bubbles burst eventually.,1,normal

Polls gave her a high enough lead that supporters didn't show up to vote. You name it, it may have given her enough votes to win. However, from my reading of it, being female had little to do with it. For my part I think its just as much a case of Obama failure as anything. That 'hope and change' really didn't materialize. But the US is highly divided. You can see that in the voting patterns of citizens initiatives. In Maine virtually every citizen initiative was divided almost fifty fifty. Want legal marijuana? Just barely over half do. A bond initiative for public transportation? DItto. Increased taxes for public education, 51%. Its not a coincidence that virtually every presidential election is decided within 8 percentage points, and thats no matter WHO runs.
